# Laravel Complete Starter

Look at the [Complete guide to Laravel and Prepr](https://docs.prepr.io/connecting-front-end-apps/laravel-complete-guide) to learn more.

## Add the environment file

Copy the .env.example file in this directory to .env (which will be ignored by Git) by running the following command:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

## Update the environment file

In the .env file replace` <YOUR-PREPR-ENDPOINT>` with the *API URL* of the Prepr *GraphQL Preview* access token from your Acme Lease Demo environment.

## Add the Prepr tracking pixel

Go to the `resources/views/pages/index.blade.php` file and replace the placeholder `<!-- Your Prepr Tracking Code -->` with your own tracking code in Prepr.
